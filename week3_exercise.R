# week 3 homework: 
# https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2020/blob/main/homework/week03/week03.pdf

# All three problems below are based on the same data. The data in data(foxes)
# are 116 foxes from 30 different urban groups in England. These foxes are like
# street gangs. Group size varies from 2 to 8 individuals. Each group maintains its own (almost exclusive) 
# urban territory. Some territories are larger
# than others. The area variable encodes this information. Some territories
# also have more avgfood than others. We want to model the weight of each
# fox. For the problems below, assume this DAG:

dag_foxes <- dagitty( "dag {
                      area -> avgfood -> groupsize -> weight
                      avgfood -> weight
                      }") 
coordinates(dag_foxes) <- list(x = c(area = 1, avgfood = 0, groupsize = 2, weight = 1),
                               y = c(area = 0, avgfood = 1, groupsize = 1, weight = 2))

# easy questions ----------------------------------------------------------

### 5E1 ###

# Which of the linear models below are multiple linear regressions?

# (1) $$\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_xi$$
# (2) $$\mu_i = \beta_x x_i + \beta_z z_i$$
# (3) $$\mu_i = \alpha + \beta(x_i â€“ z_i)$$
# (4) $$\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_x x_i + \beta_z z_i$$

## (1) contains only one predictor variable ($$\beta_xi$$) and is therefore a bivariate linear regression. 
## (2) has two predictor variables and is a multiple linear regression without an intercept ($$\alpha$$).
## (3) the right side can written as $$\alpha + \beta x_i - \beta z_i$$ which looks like a weird multiple 
# regression with negatively correlated slopes for each predictor.
## (4) is a perfectly looking multiple linear regression. 


### 5E2 ###

# Write down a multiple regression to evaluate the claim: Animal diversity is
# linearly related to latitude, but only after controlling for plant diversity.
# You just need to write down the model definition.

##  Let $$\mu_i$$ be the mean animal diversity, **L** latitude, and **P** plant diversity.
## Then $$\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_L L_i + \beta_P P_i$$


### 5E3 ###  

# Write down a multiple regression to evaluate the claim: Neither the amount of
# funding nor size of laboratory is by itself a good predictor of time to PhD
# degree; but together these variables are both positively associated with time
# to degree. Write down the model definition and indicate which side of zero
# each slope parameter should be on.

## Let $$\mu_i$$ be the time to PhD, **F** the amount of funding, and **S** the size of laboratory.
## Then $$\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_F F_i + \beta_S S_i$$ 
## Where both $$beta_F$$ & $$beta_S > 0$$ 


### 5E4 ### 

# Suppose you have a single categorical predictor with 4 levels (unique values),
# labeled A, B, C, and D. Let Ai be an indicator variable that is 1 where case i
# is in category A. Also suppose Bi, Ci, and Di for the other categories. Now
# which of the following linear models are inferentially equivalent ways to
# include the categorical variable in a regression? Models are inferentially
# equivalent when itâ€™s possible to compute one posterior distribution from the
# posterior distribution of another model.

# (1) $$\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_A A_i + \beta_B B_i + \beta_D D_i$$
# (2) $$\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_A A_i + \beta_B B_i + \beta_C C_i + \beta_D D_i$$
# (3) $$\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_B B_i + \beta_C C_i + \beta_D D_i$$
# (4) $$\mu_i = \alpha_A A_i + \alpha_B B_i + \alpha_C C_i + \alpha_D D_i$$
# (5) $$\mu_i = \alpha_A (1 â€“ B_i â€“ C_i â€“ D_i) + \alpha_B B_i + \alpha_C C_i + \alpha_D D_i$$

# This question was a bit to complicated for me and I just copied over the
# answer from [Jeffrey Girard]():

# The first model includes a single intercept (for category C) and slopes for A,
# B, and D. The second model is non-identifiable because it includes a slope for
# all possible categories (page 156). The third model includes a single
# intercept (for category A) and slopes for B, C, and D. The fourth model uses
# the unique index approach to provide a separate intercept for each category
# (and no slopes). The fifth model uses the reparameterized approach on pages
# 154 and 155 to multiply the intercept for category A times 1 when in category
# A and times 0 otherwise. Models 1, 3, 4, and 5 are inferentially equivalent
# because they each allow the computation of each otherâ€™s posterior distribution
# (e.g., each categoryâ€™s intercept and difference from each other category).

# It is sometimes observed that the best predictor of fire risk is the presence
# of firefightersâ€”States and localities with many firefighters also have more
# fires. Presumably firefighters do not cause fires. Nevertheless, this is not a
# spurious correlation. Instead fires cause firefighters. Consider the same
# reversal of causal inference in the context of the divorce and marriage data.
# How might a high divorce rate cause a higher marriage rate? Can you think of a
# way to evaluate this relationship, using multiple regression?

# after a divorce, there are two new individuals on the "wedding market".
# Divorce rate could hence be related to marriage rate by increasing the pool of
# potential individuals one can marry. This could be tested by tracking each
# individual after a divorce to see whether they get re-married again. This
# re-marriage rate could then be used in a multiple linear regression framework,
# where marriage rate is the outcome, and divorce rate and re-marriage rate are
# the predictors. If divorce rate was related to marriage rate in a bivariate
# regression framework, but not when adding re-marriage rate in a multiple
# regression, then re-marriage is the driving force for the spurious correlation
# between divorce and marriage rate.

# One way to reason through multiple causation hypotheses is to imagine detailed
# mechanisms through which predictor variables may influence outcomes. For
# example, it is sometimes argued that the price of gasoline (predictor
# variable) is positively associated with lower obesity rates (outcome
# variable). However, there are at least two important mechanisms by which the
# price of gas could reduce obesity. First, it could lead to less driving and
# therefore more exercise. Second, it could lead to less driving, which leads to
# less eating out, which leads to less consumption of huge restaurant meals. Can
# you outline one or more multiple regressions that address these two
# mechanisms? Assume you can have any predictor data you need.

# One could use a multiple regression framework with three predictors, the first
# one being price of gasoline. For the second one, we need to track the time
# spent walking of each individual to measure the effect of driving less. For
# the third one, we need to track the frequency of meals consumed at restaurants
# for each individual. a potential model could hence be:

# $$\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_g G_i + \beta_w W_i + \beta_f  F_i$$
# where mu is the mean obesity rate, G the price of gasoline, W the walking rate
# (per day), and F the amount of restaurant food

# food is positively related to weight in a model with avgfood and groupsize as
# predictors. This relationship is lost when adding groupsize as a predictor to
# the model


# (a) Is avgfood or area a better predictor of bodyweight? If you had to choose
# one or the other to include in a model, which would it be? Support your
# assessment with any tables or plots you choose.

# Comparing Model 3, 4, and 5 (see plot above) shows that avgfood generally has
# a higher effect on weight than area, even if the uncertainty is a bit higher.
# I would therefore choose avgfood.

# However, I think that this really depends on the research question and what is
# already known about fox behaviour. Looking at the coefficient estimates, both
# are positively related to weight, but effects are reduced when they are in the
# same model (see b below) Assuming that more area for a fox group increases
# their access to food, I would use area as it is the direct causal variable.
# But it could as well be that more food increases the area you can roam as a
# fox, as you have more power. In this case, I would use food as a predictor.


# (b) When both avgfood or area are in the same model, their effects are reduced
# (closer to zero) and their standard errors are larger than when they are
# included in separate models. Can you explain this result?

# Area and avgfood are strongly correlated:

# this phenomen is called multicollinearity. When adding both parameters as
# predictors in a multiple regression, the partial effect of each becomes
# smaller after controlling for the other (this is what we can see when
# comparing Model 3, 4, and 5). It could be that both parameters share a common
# unobserved cause, or that one parameter causes the other. Either way, it would
# be wiser to include only one of these parameter (food OR area) in the final
# model.
